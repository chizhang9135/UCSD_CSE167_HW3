# CSE 167 HW3

## Optimization I done:
1. for 3_3, When press R, reset the camera to the initial position


## Normal Part
1. using the same way as write up instruct to run
2. pre-rendering image is in `output` folder
3. run the scene I create with `./balboa -hw 3_5 file_name`


### Notes: Need to change `cameraSpeedFactor` and `sensitivity` in `MyCamera.h` to get proper speed.
```c++
const float cameraSpeedFactor = 150.0f;
const float sensitivity = 0.1f;  // Adjust sensitivity as needed
```


## Extra Credit
1. hw_3_3:
   1. mouse control
   2. TODO
   3. TODO

### Part Completed:
