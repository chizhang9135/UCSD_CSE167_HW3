# CSE 167 HW3

## Optimization I done:


## Normal Part
1. using the same way as write up instruct to run
2. pre-rendering image is in `output` folder
3. run the scene I create with `./balboa -hw 3_5 file_name`

### Notes: Need to change `cameraSpeedFactor` in hw3.cpp to get proper speed.
```c++
cameraSpeedFactor = x.xf; // change x.xf to a proper value
```
This is variable is used to control the speed of camera movement.
1. For hw_3_2, change it to 2f
2. For hw_3_3:
   1. For bunny, change it to 0.5f
   2. For buddha, change it to 10.0f
   3. For cube, change it to 2.5f
   3. For teapot, change it to 8.0f
   4. For two_shapes, change it to 2.5f
   5. for spheres, change it to 2.5f

## Extra Credit
